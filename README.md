# ARCWAY-to-SpecIF-Exporter
Exports a model created in [ARCWAY Cockpit](http://www.arcway.com/) to SpecIF. All diagrams ("plans"), model elements and requirements together with their relations are exported; [examples](http://specif.de/#beispiele) of generated models can be seen here. Diagrams are exported as scalable vector graphics (SVG); the types, objects and relations in [SpecIF format](https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF).

## Installation
The exporter is a script for the Apache Velocity template engine built into ARCWAY Cockpit. Install it using the properties dialog of 'Reports' ('Berichtsvorlagen'), which is accessible via context menue, within an ARCWAY Cockpit project.
